## üíª About this project
Welcome to the Space-Cream Layout challenge - Stage Three! In this advanced stage, we took the Space-Cream layout to new heights by adopting a mobile-first approach and incorporating captivating animations on the cards. This README.md provides an overview of the enhancements we made to create an even more impressive user experience.
### Mobile-First Approach: Prioritizing Mobile Users

We believe in putting the user first, which is why we embraced the mobile-first approach. Our design process began by focusing on creating a seamless experience for mobile users. By building the layout with mobile devices in mind from the start, we ensure that the website is fully responsive and optimized for a wide range of screen sizes.

### Captivating Animations: Cards Come to Life

To inject life and interactivity into the layout, we added captivating animations to the cards. When users interact with the cards, they'll experience delightful animations that draw attention and create a memorable browsing journey. These subtle yet visually appealing animations elevate the overall user experience, making the website engaging and enjoyable to explore.
